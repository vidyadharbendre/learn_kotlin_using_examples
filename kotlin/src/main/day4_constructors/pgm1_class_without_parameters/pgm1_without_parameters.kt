 *
 * Significance:
 * This program demonstrates the use of a simple class without parameters in Kotlin.
 * The class is designed to represent a basic entity with no properties or parameters.
 *
 * When to Use:
 * - Use a class without parameters when you need to represent an entity or concept that does not require
 *   any initial values or attributes.
 * - Ideal for encapsulating behavior or functionality that does not depend on any specific state.
 *
 * Note:
 * This code can be run in the Kotlin Playground at https://play.kotlinlang.org/.

class pgm1_without_parameters {
    // Class body can be empty or include methods and properties
    // Class without parameters
}

// Main function: Entry point of the Kotlin program
fun main() {
    // Creating an instance of Class A
    val aa = pgm1_without_parameters()

    // Since Class A has no properties or methods, nothing specific to print or demonstrate here
    println("Instance of A created successfully.")
}

/*
 * Output of the program:
 *
 * Instance of A created successfully.
 *
 * Explanation:
 * The program defines a class `A` with no properties or methods.
 * An instance of `A` is created in the `main()` function, and a message is printed to indicate successful creation.
