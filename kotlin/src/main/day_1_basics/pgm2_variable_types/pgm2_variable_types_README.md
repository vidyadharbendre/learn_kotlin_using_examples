## Program Overview
This program demonstrates the basics of Kotlin variables, showcasing how to declare, initialize, and modify variables using the `var` keyword. It illustrates the mutability of variables, allowing changes to their values after their initial assignment. The program uses simple data types like `Int` and `String` to highlight Kotlin's type inference.

## Program Explanation
- The program initially sets an integer variable `age` to 5 and a string variable `name` to "Kotlin".
- It prints the initial values of `age` and `name`.
- The variables are then reassigned new values: `age` is set to 6, and `name` is changed to "Android".
- The program prints the modified values, demonstrating Kotlin's mutability using `var`.
