/*
 * Program: Arithmetic Operations in Kotlin
 * Author: Vidyadhar Bendre
 * Date: 2-Sep-2024
 *
 * Significance:
 * This program demonstrates basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction,
 * multiplication, and division) using Kotlin. It initializes two integer variables,
 * performs arithmetic operations on them, and prints the results to the console.
 * This example helps to understand the syntax of arithmetic expressions and
 * Kotlin's `println` function for displaying output.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 * For those without access to a laptop or computer, you can run this code online using the
 *
 * Kotlin Playground at https://play.kotlinlang.org/.
 *
 * Simply copy and paste the
 * code into the editor and click 'Run' to see the output.
